### About Dataset

**What is COPD?**

**Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease**, commonly referred to as COPD, is a group of progressive lung diseases. The most common of these diseases are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Many people with COPD have both of these conditions. Emphysema slowly destroys air sacs in your lungs, which interferes with outward airflow. Bronchitis causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tubes, which allows mucus to build up.

Itâ€™s estimated that about 30 million people in the United States have COPD. As many as half are unaware that they have it. Untreated, COPD can lead to a faster progression of diseases, heart problems, and worsening respiratory infections.

**About the data**
The dataset is a cohort of patients, who had been invited to take part in a rehabilitation program to help manage their COPD.
